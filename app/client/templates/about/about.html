                <p>
                    <span class="logoOMD"></span> is a digital platform that enables groups of people to improve their collective and collaborative organization by facilitating the framing, analyzing and designing of collaborative processes as ecosystems of activities. This platform adopts a visualization format that describes collaborative processes as set of activities and therefore can help communities design, document, visualize, manage, share and understand collaborative design processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designers are increasingly becoming facilitators and organizers of socio-technical systems made of creative and productive agents. Designers are seen as having more
                    focus on creating the contexts for complex and multi-agent and multi-stakeholder design processes, rather than directly designing artifacts themselves, and this perspective falls into the domain of the Meta-Design perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designers can thus enable collaborative and distributed
                    systems through the analysis, visualization and design of their collaborative tools, platforms, processes and organizations. This platform enables both professional designers and untrained or amateur designers and users to work together in collaborative design processes thanks to the conscious and reflexive design of the activities constituting such collaborative design processes.
