                    <span class="logoOMD"></span> is a digital platform that enables groups of people to improve their collective and collaborative organization by facilitating the framing, analyzing and designing of collaborative processes as ecosystems of activities.
                    This platform adopts a visualization format that could help communities design, document, visualize, manage, share and understand collaborative design processes.

                    Broadly speaking, one of the common elements among these trends and phenomena is the new understanding of designers as facilitators and organizers of socio-technical systems made of creative and productive agents. Designers are seen as having more focus on creating the contexts for complex and multi-agent and multi-stakeholder design processes, rather than directly designing artifacts themselves, and this perspective falls into the domain of the Meta-Design perspective.

                    More specifically, this paper focuses on how, being transformed in all its activities, the Design discipline has also been investigating how to have an active role in shaping these transformations by focusing on enabling collaborative and distributed systems through the analysis, visualization and design of their collaborative tools, platforms, processes and organizations. By adopting a Meta-Design perspective, new possibilities have emerged for designers to be active agents in the organization and management of collaborative and distributed processes, especially design ones. This perspective works in several directions regarding collaborative processes and organizations, and this paper focuses specifically on its data dimension and on its related software dimension. This paper explores how the description of a process could be encoded into data and thus documented, shared and executed.

                    the introduction of the Meta-Design approach (Fischer & Scharff, 2000; Giaccardi, 2003) would be a promising strategy along two main directions: for enabling both professional designers and untrained or amateur designers and users to work together in collaborative design processes thanks to the conscious and reflexive design of the activities constituting such collaborative design processes;

                    In the context of this paper, these three directions could be then elaborated into a meta-design framework with these characteristics:

                        <em>behind</em> (or <em>designing design</em>): a focus on design tools that generate the design of processes;

                    <li>
                        <em>with</em> (or <em>designing together</em>): a digital platform that allow users to design the organization of interactions and flows between activities;
                    </li>

                        <em>between/among</em> (or <em>designing the "in- between"</em>): a focus on collaboratively designing the organization of participation in processes through an open discussion.
